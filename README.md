As urbanization continues to expand, cities face a growing environmental challenge: Urban
Heat Islands (UHIs). UHIs are localized areas within urban settings that experience
significantly higher temperatures compared to their rural surroundings. This temperature
difference arises due to human activities, heat absorption by concrete and asphalt surfaces,
and limited vegetation. Despite advancements in science and technology, UHIs remain a
persistent problem, contributing to increased energy consumption, health risks, and
environmental degradation.A promising yet underutilized approach to addressing UHIs is the large-scale adoption of
passive cooling strategies. These methods focus on reducing heat absorption and enhancing
natural cooling without relying on energy-intensive systems.
